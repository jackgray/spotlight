I use technology as an expressive device to confront the issues that I care about. It allows me to channel my frustrations towards societal ailments, which I manifests through both personal projects and my work. 
While my professional focus for the past 10 years has been in clinical psych research, I've maintained a growing personal interest in policy, the mechanisms that drive it, and the extent to which they are disengenuously shaped by personal interests and abuse of power. 
This was the essence behind my motivation to become proficient in progressive web app design--I decided I wanted the ability to self-actualize the solutions I imagined for the world's problems. 
Data drives policy and culture. And technology affects how people interact with it and each other, whether that's proving efficacy of some treatment or street traffic data that leads to a stop sign being put up on your block, the ability to collect, analyze, and distribute data is such a powerful thing to have. 
Lately, I've taken an interest in financial market mechanics and institutional malfeasance. Over the past month, Iâ€™ve leveraged skills in data extraction, 
infrastructure design, and application development to create a bespoke platform for aggregating and distributing regulatory and oversight-focused datasets.

I excel at bridging the gap between academic research science and modern strategies in a clinical research context. 
My experience spans a wide range of container-based data infrastructure and application designs, enabling me to address diverse challenges. 
I thrive in environments where understanding the interplay of complex systems is crucial, and where a creative and thoughtful approach to solution design is valued over rapid implementation.
