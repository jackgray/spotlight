# Ingesting Data From Multiple Sources with Apache NiFi

Apache NiFI can help consume data from multiple sources by integrating with S3 and Kafka Producers and Consumers.

Data stored in an S3 bucket can be automatically parsed and loaded into a database. In this case, Clickhouse sitting on top of version tracked buckets hosted by MinIO will be used.
