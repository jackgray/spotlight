# SEC Rule 605

https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/12/01/00-30131/disclosure-of-order-execution-and-routing-practices

Aimed at improving public disclosure of order execution quality. Under Rule 11Ac1-5, the SEC requires market centers that trade national market system securities to make monthly electronic reports. These reports include information about each market center's quality of executions on a stock-by-stock basis, including how market orders of various sizes are executed relative to the public quotes. These reports must also disclose information about effective spreads (the spreads actually paid by investors whose orders are routed to a particular market center). In addition, market centers must disclose the extent to which they provide executions at prices better than the public quotes to investors using limit orders.
