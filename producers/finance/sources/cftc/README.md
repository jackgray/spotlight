# Commodiity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)

Oversees commodities trading and major indices

Committment of Traders (COT) reports contain records of swap agreements containing such securities. ETFs and individual stock securities should not appear here, unless maybe theoretically if there is a mixed swap, which the swap may require reporting to CFTC and the SEC (or ICE)

OpenBB has a model to retrieve this data source, but not from SEC or ICE, making swap contracts very difficult to account for.
